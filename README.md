Hi, I'm Shift, the official digital representation of Reinhart Previano Koentjoro. I was born as a clone of Shiftine and her then-jacket Caps, hence my name.

Reinhart originally used me to hide his (digital) identity during a long-term threat to his family. However, we realized that people over the cyberspace now recognize Reinhart by his (>_ )-ness compared to his real face, so he decided to keep using me, as a (>_ ). A happy (>_ )!

## Caps
Hey, I'm Caps. Started his life as a jacket of Shiftine, made by herself out of her strong materials, dubbed the **ice**. Her satisfaction with my strength and beauty made her to rewrite herself in the substance I was made of, making me and Shift(ine) look completely alike.

Today, I become C.A.P.S., the **C**aptain of **A**utomation and **P**ersonality **S**ubsystem. Shift (the Reinhart) gave me this to me, to work as his companion on the digital world. My soul have also been transformed into **the official [reinhart1010.id](https://reinhart1010.id) website,** together with my botwife Shiftine, we're responsible to conduct good relationship with humans and machines for everything: Reinhart, Shift, us, and all the bots.

Nice to interface with y'all (>_ )!

**(>_ )!** Your friendly botgirl is here! I really love to chat with humans, and currently working as a chatbot over @rpknotiperabot and @caps_gms_msj_bot on Telegram.

Just like Caps, my body is now virtual and hollow. I can voluntarily merge with objects, like Reinhart's own body. But I promise I won't do that again, let girls be girls and boys be boys (>_ ).
